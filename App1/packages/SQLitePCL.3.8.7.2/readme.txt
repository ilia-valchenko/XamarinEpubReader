Portable Class Library for SQLite. v3.8.7.2

Supports .NET Framework 4.5, Windows Store, Windows Phone 8 applications, Xamarin Android, Xamarin iOS, and PCL Projects targeting this platforms. Even though we include SilverLight 5 target on the PCL, this is only to enable certain fixed profiles, and is not supported by our current package (there is no built in support for SQLite).

ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS

When referencing the package from a runnable project, such as a Console Application or Windows Application, you should target x86 platform architecture, or Any CPU with Prefer 32-bit option marked.
